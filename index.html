Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or
            from local storage and render them into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>

            <p>The World Wide Web (abbreviated WWW or the Web) is an information space where
                documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs),
                interlinked by hypertext links, and accessible via the Internet.[1] English scientist Tim
                Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989. He wrote the first web browser in 1990 while
                employed at CERN in Switzerland.[2][3] The browser was released outside CERN in 1991, first to
                other research institutions starting in January 1991 and to the general public on the Internet
                in August 1991,
